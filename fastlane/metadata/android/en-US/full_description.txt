K천nele is an app that offers speech-to-text based services and user interfaces to other apps. Most apps contain text fields (e.g. a search bar, or a message box) that can be edited using the on-screen keyboard. K천nele provides a keyboard that allows the text to be input and edited by speaking. (Modalities like swiping and buttons are also supported, for situations where speaking is less convenient.) Many apps (e.g. intelligent assistants and navigation apps) also contain a microphone button that is linked to either the standard Android speech recognition activity or the standard Android speech recognition service. K천nele implements both the activity and the service.

You can configure the K천nele user interface to use any speech-to-text service installed on the device. By default it uses a service that is linked to a server that supports only Estonian.
