Kõnele is an app that offers speech-to-text user interfaces to other apps. Many apps contain a text area or a text field (e.g. a search bar, or a message box) that can be edited using the <b>input method editor (IME)</b>, aka the on-screen keyboard. Kõnele provides an IME that allows text to be created via speaking. (Modalities like swiping and buttons are also supported, for situations where speaking is less convenient.) Many apps (e.g. intelligent assistants, keyboard apps, navigation apps) also contain a microphone button that is linked to the <b>standard Android speech recognition activity</b>. Kõnele provides an implementation of this activity.

Kõnele can connect to any speech recognition service available on the device but we recommend using <a href="https://github.com/Kaljurand/K6nele-service">Kõnele service</a>, which supports audio input of unlimited length, where dictation results are returned already while dictating. Its backing server runs the <a href="https://github.com/alumae/kaldi-gstreamer-server">kaldi-gstreamer-server</a> software and is pre-configured to provide Estonian speech recognition, but being based on a fully open-source stack makes it easy to deploy (locally) and customize for other languages.
