[android_things/](android_things/) documents how to use Kõnele on Android Things.

[android_wear/](android_wear/) documents how to use Kõnele on Android Wear.

[launch-k6nele.sh](launch-k6nele.sh) is an example of launching Kõnele using `adb shell am`.

[components.dot](components.dot) is a diagram of Kõnele components among Android APIs and apps.

[intents.dot](intents.dot) is a diagram showing how information can flow from Kõnele to external devices/apps and back.

[Rewrite rule examples](http://kaljurand.github.io/K6nele/docs/et/user_guide.html#näited)
contains (mostly) Estonian rewrite rule tables (documented in English).
A rewrite rule table contains the following tab-separated columns:

- Comment. Free-form comment
- Locale. Regular expression to match the locale of the utterance (e.g. "et")
- Service. Regular expression to match the recognizer service class name
- App. Regular expression to match the app package name
- Utterance. Regular expression to match (parts of) the utterance
- Replacement. String that replaces the matched parts of the utterance
- Command. Command to be called if the expression fully matches the utterance
- Arg1. First argument of the command
- Arg2. Second argument of the command

The first line of the table is a header that names the columns. The header is optional if the table contains a single column (interpreted as Utterance) or 2 columns (interpreted as Utterance and Replacement).
Non-header lines can be commented out using an initial '#'.

Rewriting is done by:

    utt = java.util.regex.Pattern.compile( Utterance ).matcher(utt).replaceAll( Replacement )

The pre-defined commands cover cursor movement within the text and between fields, selection, replacement, copy/paste/cut,
and the editor actions `search`, `send`, `go`, and `done`. Most of the commands can be repeated or undone multiple times.
The arguments can reference expression groups by `$1`, `$2`, ... and the current selection by `@sel()`.


### Changing preferences

In order to change multiple preferences automatically, you can use the ``adb-pref.py`` script
which reads the set of preferences' key-value pairs from a set of YAML-files, and sends commands
to Kõnele to change the respective preferences.

    ./adb-pref.py --disable-confirmation | sh
    read
    ./adb-pref.py prefs_{clips,developer,user_guide_rewrites,private}.yml | sh

Note that every preference has a type (Boolean, String, ...). If the type of a preference listed in the YAML-file
does not match with the one expected by Kõnele, a crash can occur (``ClassCastException``), and part of Kõnele might
become unusable (e.g. the Settings-activity does not open). In this case clear all Kõnele data via Android's system
settings (app-specific ``Clear storage`` or ``Clear data``, depending on your Android version), and fix the type in your YAML file.
